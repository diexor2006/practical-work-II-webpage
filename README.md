    Problems during the development.

The development of the multi-page web application for the UFV Web Frontend Workshop 16 presented several challenges that necessitated strategic problem-solving. One of the primary issues was the constant need to adjust the website's styles, which led to inefficiencies and wasted time. I found myself frequently revisiting CSS to achieve the desired aesthetic, ultimately prompting the creation of a comprehensive style guide to maintain consistency and coherence across all pages, and at the end, the apparience of the web was very simple. Additionally, integrating a functional and responsive navigation menu proved difficult, as I struggled to implement a dropdown feature that worked seamlessly across different devices. After researching various JavaScript libraries, I successfully used Bootstrap to simplify this process. The publication of the website was also complicated because there were a lot of errors and I made it at the last couple of hours, and in the beggining the home page crashed within few seconds. Moreover, performing multiple Git pushes, because I was told not to do more than six, but y made a mistake and made a lot more. Browser compatibility issues emerged as another significant hurdle, with discrepancies in rendering across browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, which required thorough testing to ensure uniformity in design. Implementing CSS resets and using BrowserStack facilitated a consistent user experience. Additionally, prolonged coding sessions led to eye strain and fatigue, which affected focus; I countered this by adopting the Pomodoro Technique and improving my workspace ergonomics.  But the most common problem was that when I forgot to close codes like <p> or something similar, and i wasted a lot of time on this, trying to figurate out what was wrong, and it was a simple thing. 

I got really tired doing this.

    Conclusions.

Through this web development project, I have employed a variety of HTML semantics, CSS styling principles, and JavaScript functionalities to create a cohesive and engaging web experience. The structured approach to each page, utilizing the correct HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>, reflects a thorough understanding of modern web standards. Each coding decision was thoughtfully considered to ensure optimally designed interfaces that are user-friendly, accessible, and educationally beneficial, aligning with the overarching goals of the UFV Web Frontend Workshop. This project not only showcases technical skills but also the ability to create intuitive, interactive, and informative web applications.
